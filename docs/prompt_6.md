Awesome understanding! Now help me to carefully review and validate the application codebase shared in the `project_codebase_files_set.md` attached. All the files in the current project codebase are listed in the `currect_project_file_structure.txt` attached, meaning if you want to look for a file and it is not in this list, then treat it as non-existent. Some of the codebase files have been modified / updated due to the recent improvement effort specified in the attached document `Improvement Plan.md` which subsequently caused regression errors, so another round of bug fixing followed as specified in the attached document `regression_remedy_execution_plan.md`. The list of superseded (recently changed) codebase files can be found in the attached `recently_changed_codebase_files_list.txt` and the actual content of these files can be found in the attached `recently_changed_codebase_files_set.md`. Carefully and systematically review the original codebase files and the updated code files. Use line by line comparison of the updated codebase files against their original versions to gain a deep and thorough understanding of the actual changes, then put on your deep thinking hat to carefully and systematically double-check and validate the changes against the improvement plan, pay particular attention to potential regression errors like omission of original features and functions or alteration in application behavior. I have identified a serious regression error which is that when I click on a listed project label in the Side Nav Bar, it opens a *blank* page while the original codebase before the refactoring correctly open a new workspace UI screen to allow the user to continue interacting with the Claude Code on the *opened* project.

Particularly you need to carefully and systematically review the newly superseded files and compare them to their original versions to double-check and validate the changes for accuracy and correctness. Be very vigilant to look out for any logic or coding errors, especially omission of original features and functions that can lead to regression errors. Use line by line comparison of the recent version versus the original version to confirm the correct implementation of the improvements specified in the execution plan `Improvement Plan.md`. Also carefully review and validate the remaining, yet to be implemented changes suggested. 

I trust that you will do your utmost due diligence to carefully and systematically review the current project codebase (`project_codebase_files_set.md` + `recently_changed_codebase_files_set.md`) using line by line comparison to have a very thorough and deep understanding of the codebase.

Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase, then create for me a detailed architecture overview document in markdown and named `Project Architecture Overview Document.md`. Make sure you do a careful review and validation of the application codebase shared. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase. Use at least 6000 words for the document that accurately describes the codebase in detail, use a clear diagram to show the codebase relationship. Include a section to describe the file structure and the purpose of each folder and key files, start with a diagram.

awesome job so far! please use the same rigor and meticulous approach to cautiously and systematically generate the files in step 1 in your remedy plan. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```python (or ```js or ```sql or ```json) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.
