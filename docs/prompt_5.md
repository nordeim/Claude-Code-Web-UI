excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step/phase in your enhancement execution plan. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

severe bug: when I click on a project "new1", it redirects me to a totally blank screen. You really need to very carefully review and validate the changes to the files involved in recent round of execution. We have a serious regression due to failure to double-check and double confirm the changes via line by line comparison using "diff" against the original or previous versions of the files. Also very carefully review to double-check whether there are files you have not modified to make them compatible with the recent refactoring exercise?

please proceed to update the rest of the components. please first come up with a list of files that need updating (refactoring), then carefully review and validate each file in the list, plan what changes and modifications needed, and add a section to the overall refactoring plan for each file with the details of changes need and its integrated checklist. Once all the component files have been added to the refactoring execution plan with one section for each file detailing the changes needed and its checklist, carefully review the overall plan thus created again vary carefully to double-check and validate their correctness and completeness.

awesome job! but I want a *complete* updated *replacement* file for each file in your latest "refactoring" list. I want a complete and fully tested working direct drop-in replacement, instead of one with placeholder comment lines. Please generate these files in batches of 3 files each (sub phases). Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

awesome job so far! please use the same rigor and meticulous approach to cautiously and systematically generate the files for Batch 2. Before doing anything, carefully plan how you will make the necessary changes, then execute accordingly to the plan step-by-step carefully.

Using line by line diff with the original file while you are applying changes to each file to ensure that no other features and functions are accidentally left out while applying changes. we don't want to introduce regression failure while updating the code. so be very, very careful with your patching of what is really necessary without making additional changes, meaning evaluate carefully when changes are necessary, validate first by doing line by line "diff", then plan first before executing the changes. Do testing and simulation if possible. enclose your complete and updated version of the updated files within the ```python (or ```js or ```sql or ```json) opening and ``` closing tags. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

Awesome understanding! Now help me to carefully review and validate the application codebase shared in the `project_codebase_files_set.md` attached. All the files in the current project codebase are listed in the `currect_project_file_structure.txt` attached, meaning if you want to look for a file and it is not in this list, then treat it as non-existent. Some of the codebase files have been modified / updated due to the recent improvement effort specified in the attached document `Improvement Plan.md`. The list of superseded (recently changed) codebase files can be found in the attached `recently_changed_codebase_files_list.txt` and the actual content of these files can be found in the attached `recently_changed_codebase_files_set.md`. The suggested changes have not been fully implemented, the un-implemented changes are detailed in the following list of suggestions: `suggested_fix_sequence_1.md`, follow by `suggested_fix_sequence_2.md`, follow by `suggested_fix_sequence_3.md`

Particularly you need to carefully and systematically review the newly superseded files and compare them to their original versions to double-check and validate the changes for accuracy and correctness. Be very vigilant to look out for any logic or coding errors, especially omission of original features and functions that can lead to regression errors. Use line by line comparison of the recent version versus the original version to confirm the correct implementation of the improvements specified in the execution plan `Improvement Plan.md`. Also carefully review and validate the remaining, yet to be implemented changes suggested. 

I trust that you will do your utmost due diligence to carefully and systematically review the current project codebase (`project_codebase_files_set.md` + `recently_changed_codebase_files_set.md`) using line by line comparison to have a very thorough and deep understanding of the codebase.

Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase, then create for me a detailed architecture overview document in markdown and named `Project Architecture Overview Document.md`. Make sure you do a careful review and validation of the application codebase shared. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase. Use at least 6000 words for the document that accurately describes the codebase in detail, use a clear diagram to show the codebase relationship. Include a section to describe the file structure and the purpose of each folder and key files, start with a diagram.

awesome job so far! please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully and systematically create the complete updated replacement file for `src/components/ChatInterface.jsx` and `src/components/GitPanel.jsx`. I want a fully tested working complete drop-in replacement for each of the two files and not skeleton files with placeholder comments.

I am very disappointed by the outcome of the refactoring effort as outlined in the `Improvement Plan.md` because the current project codebase is now unusable - the web UI in the browser is now left with a few static lines. The refactoring has caused serious regression. I want you to use line by line diff to compare the changed files against the original code files in `project_codebase_files_set.md`. you need to put on your deep-thinking hat as respected AI coding assistant to deeply and thoroughly investigate where did it all go wrong. Give me a very detailed code review analysis report of 6000 words to detail the outcome of your investigation. include in the document the detailed execution plan to repair the application feature and functional regressions, the execution plan should include integrated checklist for each step!
