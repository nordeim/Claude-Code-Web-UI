Thank you for providing the `diff`. I have performed the requested rigorous and meticulous review.

### Validation of `diff -u src/components/FileTree.jsx-original src/components/FileTree.jsx`

My analysis confirms the following changes:

1.  **Lines 7-10: Context Integration**
    *   **Change:** The function signature was changed from `function FileTree({ selectedProject })` to `function FileTree()`. The `useApp` hook is imported and used to retrieve `selectedProject`.
    *   **Verdict:** **Correct.** This is the primary refactoring step and is implemented perfectly.

2.  **Lines 19-21: `useEffect` Logic Enhancement**
    *   **Change:** An `else` block was added to the `useEffect` hook that depends on `selectedProject`. This new block explicitly clears the `files` state (`setFiles([])`) when `selectedProject` becomes `null`.
    *   **Verdict:** **Correct and Necessary Improvement.** The original code did not handle the "deselection" of a project. This change ensures that if a user deselects a project, the file tree correctly clears itself instead of continuing to show the files of the previously selected project. This prevents a stale UI and improves the component's logical correctness.

3.  **Lines 24-28: `fetchFiles` Guard Clause**
    *   **Change:** A guard clause (`if (!selectedProject) { ... }`) was added at the beginning of the `fetchFiles` function.
    *   **Verdict:** **Correct and Necessary Improvement.** This is a critical defensive check. It prevents the `fetch` call from being made with an `undefined` project name if the function were ever called in a state where `selectedProject` is null. This makes the component more robust and prevents unnecessary, malformed API calls.

4.  **Lines 148-154: Empty State Addition**
    *   **Change:** A new conditional rendering block was added to display a "Select a project to view its files" message if `selectedProject` is `null`.
    *   **Verdict:** **Correct.** This improves the user experience by providing clear feedback to the user about the required action, whereas the original component would have simply rendered nothing.

### Final Conclusion

The `diff` analysis confirms that all changes are not only correct but also represent significant improvements in the component's robustness and user experience. The core logic for fetching and rendering the file tree remains completely intact. No features have been omitted.

The refactored `src/components/FileTree.jsx` is a complete, validated, and improved drop-in replacement.
